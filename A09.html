<h1>Movie Reviews</h1>
<p> &ldquo;lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of the players rather than ddealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would have not been so bad but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing &rdquo; </p>
<p> &ldquo;I am watching this for the third time, Trying to understand how this large group of capitilist pigs could royally screw thier famlis, descendents, neighbors, countrymen nd the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion&rdquo;</p>
